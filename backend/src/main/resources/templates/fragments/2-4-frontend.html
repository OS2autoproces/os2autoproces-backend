			The SAML flow is handled by the backend, but the frontend needs to be aware of
			the interactions that can trigger the flow, as the frontend plays a part in
			this flow. This chapter outlines the flow that the frontend must implement.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Deal with redirects from the backend</h4>
		<p>
			When the frontend performs calls to the backend APIs using javascript, the backend
			will prevent access to the secured APIs if the user is not currently logged in (the users
			browser does not supply a valid session cookie - either because it does not have any,
			or because the session has expired).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When this happens, the backend will return a HTTP 302 (redirect), with a Location header
			set to the discovery page, expecting the browser to perform an actual navigation to
			the discovery page, so the user can perform a login.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The frontend must deal with these 302 responses correctly, and instead of redirecting
			the javascript query to the new location, perform a browser navigation to the discovery
			page... as the discovery page is a well-known resource, the javascript code could look
			for this specific endpoint, and perform the browser navigation in that specific scenario,
			and default to doing javascript query-redirect in all other cases.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Implementing a discovery page</h4>
		<p>
			<strong>NOTICE</strong>. The discovery flow will likely be removed, so wait with this section.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The temporary discovery page on the backend must be replaced by a (much) prettier discovery
			page on the frontend, and the backend must know the location of this page, so it can return
			the correct URL in the redirect mentioned above.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The backend exposes a simple API for retrieving a list of municipalities that can login to
			the solution, which can be used to retrieve a list choices for the end-user. This API should
			be used to populate the discovery page with choices.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Once the user has chosen which municipality he or she comes from, the discovery page should
			perform a navigation to the following URL on the backend
		</p>

		<pre>https://www.os2autoproces.eu/saml/login?idp=&lt;identifier&gt;</pre>
				
		<p>
			Note that the &lt;identifier&gt; value in the URL should be replaced with the identifier of the
			municipality that the user chooses. An example is shown below
		</p>
		
		<pre>https://www.os2autoproces.eu/saml/login?idp=http://adfs.digital-identity.dk/adfs/services/trust</pre>
		
		<p>
			Upon successful login, the user is redirected back to some configured endpoint on the frontend application.
