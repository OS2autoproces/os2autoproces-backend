		<p>
			In the cases where the restrictions of the Spring Data REST framework is a limiting factor,
			custom APIs are implemented in OS2autoproces. These APIs does not offer the same CRUD-like
			operations of the Spring Data REST APIs, but are limited to exactly the operations required
			by the functionality in the frontend. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The custom APIs can be modified much more easily than the generated ones, so where needed,
			there is some flexibility in the development proces for these APIs.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			All of these APIs are secured in the same way as the generated APIs.
